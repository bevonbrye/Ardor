Ardor is a new take on a classic game (Hangman) that brings the user on a more fulfilling journey - obscure in its nature but rewarding by its end. 

## Game Rules: 

User has the option to choose letters from a word bank. If the user guesses wrong x amount of times, then the game ends. If the user guesses all the letter right, the next round is initiated 



## History: 
Though the origins of the game are unknown, a variant is mentioned in a book of children's games assembled by Alice Gomme in 1894 called Birds, Beasts, and Fishes. This version lacks the image of a hanged man, instead relying on keeping score as to the number of attempts it took each player to fill in the blanks.
